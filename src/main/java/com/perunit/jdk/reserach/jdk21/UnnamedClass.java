Commented due to rules:
- An unnamed class is always a member of the unnamed package. So we cannot declare a package statement in it.
- Since we cannot refer to the unnamed class by its name, we cannot create a constructor as well.
- An unnamed class is always final and it cannot extend another class (except Object) or implement an interface.
